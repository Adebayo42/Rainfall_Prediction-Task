# Rainfall Prediction: Machine Learning Application

🌧️ **Overview**

Accurate rainfall prediction is crucial for agriculture, water resource management, and disaster preparedness. This project builds a **machine learning pipeline** to predict rainfall using ensemble models, advanced preprocessing, and Bayesian Optimization for hyperparameter tuning.

📌 **Key Features:**

✅ **Multi-Model Approach:** Utilizes **Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, LightGBM, and Stacking Classifier**  
✅ **Data Preprocessing:** Handles missing values, feature scaling, and categorical encoding  
✅ **Imbalanced Data Handling:** Uses **SMOTE** to balance the dataset  
✅ **Hyperparameter Optimization:** Implements **Bayesian Optimization** for improved model performance  
✅ **Scalability:** Designed to be extendable for real-world climate prediction systems

🛠 **How It Works**

1️⃣ **Data Preprocessing:**  
   - Handle missing values  
   - Encode categorical variables (`category_encoders`)  
   - Feature scaling with `StandardScaler`  
   - Apply **SMOTE** for imbalanced data  

2️⃣ **Model Training & Stacking:**  
   - Train individual models (**Random Forest, and XGBoost**)  
   - Combine them using **Stacking Classifier** with **LightGBM** as the meta-learner for improved predictions  

3️⃣ **Hyperparameter Tuning:**  
   - Optimize model performance with **Bayesian Optimization**  
   
4️⃣ **Evaluation Metrics:**  
   - Compute **Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, and ROC-AUC Score**

🏆 **Why This Project Stands Out**

🔹 Demonstrates real-world **data science skills**: feature engineering, imbalanced data handling, model optimization  
🔹 **Employs advanced ensemble learning techniques** for better predictions  
🔹 **Scalable & adaptable** for broader climate and weather forecasting applications
